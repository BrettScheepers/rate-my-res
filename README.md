# Rate My Res

Rate My Res is a web app designed to allow students to write their own reviews for the residence that they live in and aggregates them all on a single website.

## Description

This web app allows the user to search through universities in South Africa and read reviews of their student housing options. Student housing is sorted by university and each housing option is given an overall rating. This rating is an average of the residence's room, bathroom, building and location. Other parameters like class-year population and amenities are included in the review to allow the user that's looking for a suitable residence room to find the one that best meets their needs.

The app allows any user to leave a review on the website or add a residence that they could not find. Submissions get personally reviewed by myself and if they are successful they get added to the database.
